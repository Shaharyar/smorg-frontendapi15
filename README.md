SmOrg Application
-----------------


A Free Smart organizer that uses Google Calendar as its calendar back-end and adds (if we did) some extra features on GAE that help in time 
organizing and management.

This app is to hit Android Market as soon as our noob team starts to live in their geeky coding bubble.
